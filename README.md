## Al-Amode 
### mode matching and beam propagation solutions for MATLAB
---
*orignally written by Nicolas Smith*


It requires MATLAB, you should add the AlaMode folder to your path
(the @ directories should be in a folder that's in your path, but they
shouldn't be in the path), or do your work in that folder.

type 'help alm' in MATLAB to begin

**example scripts (located in examples/):**
* pslmode.m - showing some basic uses
* choosecompsexample.m - shows how to use the chooseComponents method
* beamfitexample.m - uses the beam width fitting function
* customcostexample.m - shows how to define a custom cost function when optimizing your beam path
